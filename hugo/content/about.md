I'm a programmer and interested in new technologies. At work and for personal projects I'm usually using boring technology. At work I'm not a full time programmer anymore, it changed to a more process oriented job. 

I blog about code, work, technology in general and basically everything that's on my mind. This blog is also my dumpster for any thoughts I have or had.

A RSS feed is only available for blog posts. My project posts usually contain the concept on which I base my builds - they are updated from time to time, so they are not available in the RSS feed.

I try to keep this blog in English even so I'm not fluent - think about it as practice :)
